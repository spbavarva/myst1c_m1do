Linux ttl=61

# first thing

**whenever http or ssh or any service hangs, use -v with it and lower MTU**

```
sudo ifconfig tun0 mtu 1200
```

```
sudo ip l s dev tun0 mtu 1300
```

# rustscan

```

# rabbit hole

This was rabbit hole as I would started with `/.git` so that's why I knew, it was initial


# initial

nmap showed that we have access to `/.git`

![[Pasted image 20240611210611.png]]

checked everything manually and made `creds` file but then I remembered that we need to use git-dumper for this type of scenes

```
pip install git-dumper
```

```
python3 git_dumper.py http://192.168.191.144/.git data
```

OR

```
git-dumper http://192.168.191.144/.git .
```

Then just look at logs of git commit and look at HEAD

```
git log

git show HEAD
```

![[Pasted image 20240611211422.png]]

suggesting that I need to use `7z`

```
7z x sitebackup3.zip
```

![[Pasted image 20240611211511.png]]

looked at those files and got 3 passwords

```

and we already know that there's 4 total users

```
carla
chloe
