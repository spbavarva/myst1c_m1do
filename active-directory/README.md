# Active Directory

**Scenario 1 - Waiting On An Admin**

During the engagement, I compromised a single host and gained SYSTEM level access. Leveraging its domain-joined status, I enumerated the domain but found limited results. Using Kerberoasting, I retrieved TGS tickets for a few accounts. After an overnight Hashcat run with the [d3ad0ne](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/rules/d3ad0ne.rule) rule a large wordlist and d3ad0ne rule, I cracked one ticket, obtaining a user's cleartext password. With this limited access, I gained write permissions on file shares and dropped SCF files, capturing the NetNTLMv2 hash of a domain admin via Responder. From there, I escalated privileges effortlessly.



**Scenario 2 - Spraying The Night Away**

During an engagement, I discovered an SMB NULL session using enum4linux, gaining access to domain user listings and password policy. With careful password spraying within policy parameters, I cracked a weak password (Spring@18). Using the compromised account, I escalated privileges via BloodHound, obtaining a domain admin's Kerberos TGT ticket. Leveraging Rubeus, I executed a pass-the-ticket attack, gaining full domain admin access and control over a trusting domain due to nested group membership.



**Scenario 3 - Fighting In The Dark**

During the engagement, standard methods failed, so I used Kerbrute to enumerate usernames. After combining LinkedIn and GitHub lists, I found 516 valid users. Careful password spraying with Welcome2021 yielded one hit. BloodHound revealed RDP access for all users to a single box. Utilizing DomainPasswordSpray with Fall2021, I gained access to Help Desk privileges, allowing me to escalate to Enterprise Key Admins. With this access, I conducted a Shadow Credentials attack, obtaining the domain controller's NT hash. Using this hash, I executed a DCSync attack, retrieving NTLM password hashes for all domain users.
