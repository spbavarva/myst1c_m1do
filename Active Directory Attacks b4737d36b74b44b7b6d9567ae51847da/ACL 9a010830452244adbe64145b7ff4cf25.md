## ACL Attacks in the Wild

We can use ACL attacks for:

- Lateral movement
- Privilege escalation
- Persistence

Some common attack scenarios may include:

| Attack | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Abusing forgot password permissions | Help Desk and other IT users are often granted permissions to 
perform password resets and other privileged tasks. If we can take over 
an account with these privileges (or an account in a group that confers 
these privileges on its users), we may be able to perform a password 
reset for a more privileged account in the domain. |
| Abusing group membership management | It's also common to see Help Desk and other staff that have the 
right to add/remove users from a given group. It is always worth 
enumerating this further, as sometimes we may be able to add an account 
that we control into a privileged built-in AD group or a group that 
grants us some sort of interesting privilege. |
| Excessive user rights | We also commonly see user, computer, and group objects with 
excessive rights that a client is likely unaware of. This could occur 
after some sort of software install (Exchange, for example, adds many 
ACL changes into the environment at install time) or some kind of legacy
 or accidental configuration that gives a user unintended rights. 
Sometimes we may take over an account that was given certain rights out 
of convenience or to solve a nagging problem more quickly. |
