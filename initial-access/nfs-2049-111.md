# NFS - 2049, 111

### Network Port Vulnerabilities

Ports **2049** and **111** (TCP/UDP) lack built-in authentication, posing a risk.

#### Scanning Command

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -p111,2049 -sV -sC
```

### Exploiting NFS

```bash
showmount -e <FQDN/IP>
```

Replace `<FQDN/IP>` with the fully qualified domain name or IP address of the target machine.

To mount the NFS share:

```bash
mkdir target-nfs
```

```bash
sudo mount -t nfs <FQDN/IP>:/full/path/to/share/from/showmount ./target-nfs/ -o nolock
```

#### Unmounting the NFS Share

Unmounting the NFS share when you're done is generally a good practice, although it's not strictly mandatory:

```bash
sudo umount ./target-nfs
```

This ensures that all file operations are completed and prevents potential data loss.
