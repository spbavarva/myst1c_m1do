# Communication with Processes

### More on Named Pipes

Pipes are used for communication between two applications or processes using shared memory. There are two types of pipes, [named pipes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/named-pipes) and anonymous pipes. An example of a named pipe is `\\.\PipeName\\ExampleNamedPipeServer`.
 Windows systems use a client-server implementation for pipe 
communication. In this type of implementation, the process that creates a
 named pipe is the server, and the process communicating with the named 
pipe is the client. Named pipes can communicate using `half-duplex`, or a one-way channel with the client only being able to write data to the server, or `duplex`,
 which is a two-way communication channel that allows the client to 
write data over the pipe, and the server to respond back with data over 
that pipe. Every active connection to a named pipe server results in the
 creation of a new named pipe. These all share the same pipe name but 
communicate using a different data buffer.

We can use the tool [PipeList](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/pipelist) from the Sysinternals Suite to enumerate instances of named pipes.

Additionally, we can use PowerShell to list named pipes using `gci` (`Get-ChildItem`).

After obtaining a listing of named pipes, we can use [Accesschk](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/accesschk)
 to enumerate the permissions assigned to a specific named pipe by 
reviewing the Discretionary Access List (DACL), which shows us who has 
the permissions to modify, write, read, or execute a resource. Let's 
take a look at the `LSASS` process. We can also review the DACLs of all named pipes using the command  `.\accesschk.exe /accepteula \pipe\`.

### Reviewing LSASS Named Pipe Permissions

```
C:\htb> accesschk.exe /accepteula \\.\Pipe\lsass -v

\\.\Pipe\lsass

        FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES
        FILE_READ_DATA
        FILE_READ_EA
        FILE_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES
        FILE_WRITE_DATA
        FILE_WRITE_EA
        SYNCHRONIZE
        READ_CONTROL
  RW NT AUTHORITY\ANONYMOUS LOGON
        FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES
        FILE_READ_DATA
        FILE_READ_EA
        FILE_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES
        FILE_WRITE_DATA
        FILE_WRITE_EA
        SYNCHRONIZE
        READ_CONTROL
  RW APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\Your Windows credentials
        FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES
        FILE_READ_DATA
        FILE_READ_EA
        FILE_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES
        FILE_WRITE_DATA
        FILE_WRITE_EA
        SYNCHRONIZE
        READ_CONTROL
  RW BUILTIN\Administrators
        FILE_ALL_ACCESS

```

From the output above, we can see that only administrators have full access to the LSASS process, as expected.

## Named Pipes Attack Example

Let's walk through an example of taking advantage of an exposed named pipe to escalate privileges. This [WindscribeService Named Pipe Privilege Escalation](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48021) is a great example. Using `accesschk` we can search for all named pipes that allow write access with a command such as `accesschk.exe -w \pipe\* -v` and notice that the `WindscribeService` named pipe allows `READ` and `WRITE` access to the `Everyone` group, meaning all authenticated users.

### Checking WindscribeService Named Pipe Permissions

Confirming with `accesschk` we see that the Everyone group does indeed have `FILE_ALL_ACCESS` (All possible access rights) over the pipe.
