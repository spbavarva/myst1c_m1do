# # Unquoted Service Path

Search for services which can auto start or have unquoted with space in between

### Permissions

You can use sc to get information of a service

```bash
sc qc <service_name>
```

### List all unquoted service paths, excluding those belonging to built-in Windows services:

```powershell
gwmi -class Win32_Service -Property Name, DisplayName, PathName, StartMode | Where {$_.StartMode -eq "Auto" -and $_.PathName -notlike "C:\Windows*" -and $_.PathName -notlike '"*'} | select PathName,DisplayName,Name
```


***

### Example

Example Path: C:\Program Files(x86)\ABC\DEF GHI.exe

* [ ] if we have permission to write in ABC folder then create DEF.exe in there
* [ ] first check that service is running by localsystem or other user because it will be only helpful if it has different user
* [ ] then start and stop the that service or restart whole services
