# Credentialed Enumerating Security Controls

### **Windows Defender**

```markdown
We can use the built-in PowerShell cmdlet Get-MpComputerStatus to get the current Defender status. Here, we can see that the RealTimeProtectionEnabled parameter is set to True, which means Defender is enabled on the system

PS C:\htb> Get-MpComputerStatus

### **AppLocker**

```markdown
Organizations also often focus on blocking the PowerShell.exe executable, but forget about the other PowerShell executable locations such as %SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe or PowerShell_ISE.exe. We can see that this is the case in the AppLocker rules shown below. All Domain Users are disallowed from running the 64-bit PowerShell executable located at:

%SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe

PS C:\htb> Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective | select -ExpandProperty RuleCollections

### [Local Administrator Password Solution](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46899)

```markdown
The Microsoft Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) is used to randomize and rotate local administrator passwords on Windows hosts and prevent lateral movement. We can enumerate what domain users can read the LAPS password set for machines with LAPS installed and what machines do not have LAPS installed. The LAPSToolkit greatly facilitates this with several functions. One is parsing ExtendedRights for all computers with LAPS enabled. This will show groups specifically delegated to read LAPS passwords, which are often users in protected groups. An account that has joined a computer to a domain receives All Extended Rights over that host, and this right gives the account the ability to read passwords. Enumeration may show a user account that can read the LAPS password on a host. 

PS C:\htb> Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups

### **Using Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights**

```markdown
The Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights checks the rights on each computer with LAPS enabled for any groups with read access and users with "All Extended Rights." Users with "All Extended Rights" can read LAPS passwords and may be less protected than users in delegated groups, so this is worth checking for.

PS C:\htb> Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights

ComputerName                Identity                    Reason
------------                --------                    ------
EXCHG01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins Delegated
EXCHG01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL INLANEFREIGHT\LAPS Admins   Delegated
SQL01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL   INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins Delegated
SQL01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL   INLANEFREIGHT\LAPS Admins   Delegated
WS01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL    INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins Delegated
WS01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL    INLANEFREIGHT\LAPS Admins   Delegated
```

### **Using Get-LAPSComputers**

```markdown
We can use the Get-LAPSComputers function to search for computers that have LAPS enabled when passwords expire, and even the randomized passwords in cleartext if our user has access.

PS C:\htb> Get-LAPSComputers

ComputerName                Password       Expiration
